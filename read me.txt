**Bulb-Alicious**

The website is designed for individuals who have a passion for gardening, specifically those interested in growing flowers at home. It is intended for garden enthusiasts who enjoy gardening as a hobby and want to add beautiful, home-grown flowers to their gardens. It is also for flower lovers who may not have much gardening experience but appreciate flowers and are looking for easy-to-purchase bulbs or seasonal flowers. DIY gardeners who prefer to grow their own flowers at home can also benefit from the website by exploring specific varieties of bulbs or plants. The website is suitable for anyone, anywhere, who wants to learn about and explore a wide variety of bulbs and flowers. The website has been designed with simplicity in mind, so even those with minimal technical skills or online shopping experience can navigate it easily. Finally, it caters to eco-conscious shoppers who are interested in sustainable gardening practices and want to support a local, environmentally-minded business.

**Main Features**
The website features simple and clear navigation, with distinct pages for Bulbs, Seasonal Flowers, Sign-Up, Contact/About, and Account. Users can browse different types of bulbs and flowers, with helpful blurbs describing each type. Seasonal flowers are highlighted in a separate section for inspiration.
The website has been tested on both mobile and tablet formats to ensure the layout adapts correctly and remains readable and visually appealing across devices.

**Future Improvements**
Future improvements for the website could include:
Adding detailed growing guides for each type of bulb or flower, including sunlight and water requirements.
Highlighting which varieties are easy to grow and which may be more challenging without the right conditions.
Transforming the site into a full e-commerce store, allowing users to purchase bulbs, seasonal flowers, and gardening supplies directly online, making it both an educational and transactional resource for gardeners.

**Manual Testing**
Most of the code was tested in Visual Studio Code, checking the layout, image display, and responsiveness on different screen sizes.

**Deployment Challenges**
Deploying the website required careful consideration of mobile responsiveness and consistent styling across pages. Some initial issues occurred with CSS conflicts and image alignment, which have since been resolved. Linking the CSS separately for all pages was crucial to maintain a unified design. Testing on mobile and tablet formats ensured that content scales correctly and navigation remains intuitive.

**Bugs and Fixes**
Sign-Up Page Layout: The table layout initially caused a large gap between the sign-up and login boxes. Fixed by resolving conflicting styles.
Cart Functionality: Attempted to implement a basket but removed it to preserve the page styling.
Images Alignment: Inline display issues with images and text were fixed by revisiting CSS layout methods.
Social Media Links: Initial syntax errors prevented links from working. Fixed by correcting anchor tags and classes.

**User Feedback**
The site has been tested by friends and family for clarity and ease of navigation. Feedback indicated that the navigation is intuitive, the images are visually appealing, and the text is easy to read. Suggestions included adding more information about growing bulbs, which has been noted as a future improvement.
